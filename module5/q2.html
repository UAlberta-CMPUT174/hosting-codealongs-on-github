<h1>Version 1</h1>


<p>This version should contain a main function, which will ask the user for their username, 
  and call a UDF to check if the given username is valid. </p>

<p>For this version we will only consider a subset of the username requirements. For a username to be valid it must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a single '@'' sign</li>
  <li>a valid domain name</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the UDF should display a message to the user to let them know if their username is valid.</p>
<ul>
  <li>'Valid username. Proceed to set up a password.' if it is valid</li>
  <li>'Invalid username' if not valid</li>
</ul>
