<h1>Version 4</h1>

<p>For this version, we'll want to register the user only if the user clears all the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>user enters a valid username</li>
  <li>the passwords entered by the user twice are the same</li>
  <li>the password fulfills all requirements</li>
</ul>


<p>Once all the requirements are met, the <code>main</code> function should display 'Registration Complete.' 
  Otherwise, display the appropriate reason the user could not be registered.</p>
