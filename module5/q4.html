<h1>Version 3</h1>

<p>This version will add upon the previous version by checking if the password that was entered 
  complies with certain requirements. We'll also want to make adjustments to the <code>main</code> function so it will call these 4 new 
  functions only if the username is valid and the passwords entered twice by the user match.
</p>
<p>There will be 4 additional functions added in this version:</p>
<ul>

  <li><code>check_password_len</code></li> 
  <ul>
    <li>returns True if password has required length otherwise prints a message "The password must be at least 8 characters" and returns False</li>
  </ul>

  <li><code>check_password_digit</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>returns True if password has at least one digit otherwise prints a message "The password must have at least one digit." and return False</li>
  </ul>

  <li><code>check_password_capital</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>returns True if the password has at least one capital letter, otherwise it prints a message "The password must have at least one capital letter." and returns False</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li><code>check_password_special</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>returns True if the password has at least one special character otherwise it prints a message "The password must have at least one special letter." and returns False</li>
