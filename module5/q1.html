<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Billy and Nick have been chosen for an internship at Google. Their first assignment is to create a signup form that a web 
  application can use to register users. The signup form should be a program in Python that asks for a username and a password. 
  The username has to be a valid email address, and the password has to comply with certain requirements.</p>

<p>A valid email address has the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It has a single @ sign </li>
  <li>The domain name is ualberta.ca or gmail.com. </li>
  <li>A valid password must be:</li>
  <li>8 characters long</li>
  <li>has at least one digit</li>
  <li>has at least one capital letter</li>
  <li>has at least one special character or punctuation</li>
</ul>

<p>Each time the user enters a username, the application should report if the username is valid or not. 
  If it is valid, then the user will be asked to enter the password. Once the user enters the password, 
  they are asked to re-enter it to confirm that it has been entered correctly. If both entries are the same, 
  the application should proceed to check the validity of the password. The application should report if any of the 
  requirements of the password is not satisfied. If all requirements are satisfied, the program 
  should display "Registration Completed".
</p>
<p>The application should continue to ask for a username and password until the account is registered or 
  the user chooses to abort the registration by entering the letter q. If the user enters q, 
  "Registration Aborted" is displayed. Your task is to help Billy and Nick implement the program. 
</p>

<p>Let's attempt this problem by breaking it down into multiple versions. Each version after version 1 
  will contain additional features, as seen in the following table, building upon the previous version. 
  Implement and test each version thoroughly before moving onwards to the next version! </p>
