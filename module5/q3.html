<h1>Version 2</h1>

<p>In this version, we will improve upon version 1 by asking and validating the password once the user provides a valid username. 
  The program will ask the user to enter a password and re-enter it again. 
</p>

<p>Write a function that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>determines if both passwords are the same or not</li>
  <li>returns True if passwords are same</li>
  <li>returns False and printing Passwords do not match if passwords are not the same</li>
</ul>
