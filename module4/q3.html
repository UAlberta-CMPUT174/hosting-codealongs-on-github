<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Sookie currently has 4 employees working at her bistro at the rate of $20 per hour. Currently, she has to manually enter the number of hours 
  that each employee works per day in a week in a text file. Each line in the file starts with the employee's name, followed by the hours they've worked each day that week.
</p>
<p>
  For example: </p>
<pre>
	Sarah	7 4 3
	Bob 	9 2 7 5 
	David	8 8 7 8
	Mary 	6 5 7
</pre>
<p>Sookie is planning on expanding the bistro and hiring more employees. Therefore, she would like to automate the weekly payroll.</p>
<h1>Task:</h1>
<p>Improve the previous program such that it would still be able to display the correct results even when given a corrupted file.</p>
