<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Sookie currently has 4 employees working at her bistro at the rate of $20 per hour. Currently, she has to manually enter the number of hours 
  that each employee works per day in a week in a text file. Each line in the file starts with the employee's name, followed by the hours they've worked each day that week.
</p>
<p>
  For example: </p>
<pre>
	Sarah	7 4 3
	Bob 	9 2 7 5 
	David	8 8 7 8
	Mary 	6 5 7
</pre>
<p>Sookie is planning on expanding the bistro and hiring more employees. Therefore, she would like to automate the weekly payroll.</p>
<h1>Task:</h1>
<p>Help Sookie create a program that:
<ul>
  <li>reads in a text file</li>
  <li>computes and displays the total hours per week</li>
  <li>computes and displays the weekly salary for each employee</li>
  <li>finds the names of all employees who worked more than the average hours worked by all employees</li>
</ul>  
  Have the program display the information in the following matter:
</p>
<pre>
  Sarah	14	$280
  Bob	23 	$460
  David 	31 	$620
  Mary 	18	$360
  
  The average hours worked by all employees is 21.5. Bob, David worked more than 21.5 hours per week
