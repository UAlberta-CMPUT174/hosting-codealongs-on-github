<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Sookie wants to make trout cakes for her Bistro. The recipe calls for 5 trouts. In order to catch fresh trout, she goes fishing in a nearby lake. 
Sookie wants to keep the trout that she catches and release any other fish back into the lake; however, she must abide by the local fishery regulations.
</p>
<p>
The fishery regulation in her town has set a daily catch limit of 7, which means that Sookie cannot have more than 7 fish in her possession in one day.
Since the mortality rate of fish that are caught and released is high, there is also a daily catch and release limit of 3, which means that Sookie can catch and immediately release no more than 3 fish in one day.
</p>
<p>
The catch and release limit prevents Sookie from releasing all fish that are not trout, so she wants to stop fishing once she has enough fish for the trout cakes. 
</p>
<h1>Task:</h1>
<p>Create a program that helps Sookie keep track of how many trout she has caught without exceeding any limits.
  Your program should print:</p>
<ul>
  <li>'Trout cakes' if Sookie has enough trout. </li>
  <li>'Seafood medley' otherwise </li>
</ul>
