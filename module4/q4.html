<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Sookie has run into a problem recently. While working with the file, it has somehow become corrupted. The file now contains random amounts of white spaces in different areas. 
</p>
<p>
Like so:</p>
<pre>
  Sarah     7 4   3

  Bob 9 2  7 5
  
  
  David     8  8 7   8
  Mary  6   5 7 
</pre>
<h1>Task:</h1>
<p>Create a program that helps Sookie keep track of how many trout she has caught without exceeding any limits.
  Your program should print:</p>
<ul>
  <li>'Trout cakes' if Sookie has enough trout. </li>
  <li>'Seafood medley' otherwise </li>
</ul>
