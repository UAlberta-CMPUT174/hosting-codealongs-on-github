<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Tara was working on her code in a physics lab. Recently, she found that some of her calculations were not working properly.</p>

<p>In particular, when dividing or multiplying numbers with repeating decimals, she found that introduced errors in her calculations.</p>

<p>This is because of the inaccuracy of floating point numbers. This error could potentially compromise the validity of her research.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Rational</code> number call that can help Tara with her research.</p>

<p>Think about what attributes your <code>Rational</code> class should have!</p>

<h1>Problem:</h1>

<p>Create your <code>Rational</code> class and add the appropriate attributes. Make sure to write your constructor function to initialize those
attributes!</p>
