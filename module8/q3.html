<h1>Version 2:</h1>
<p>For this version we will now write some useable functions. Write the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>convert</code> which takes in a string representing the currency to convert to and a float representing the amount of CAD to convert and returns a floating point which represents how much the given CAD would be worth in the currency</li>
  <li><code>display_result</code> which takes in a string representing the currency to convert to and a float representing the amount of CAD to convert and prints out a message stating what the given amount of CAD is worth in the given currency</li>
  <li><code>main</code> should now ask the user how much CAD they would like to convert, and print out the conversions for that amount in EUR, INR, and UZS</li>
</ul>
