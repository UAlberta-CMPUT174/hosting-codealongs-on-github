<h1>Version 3:</h1>
<p>For this version we will now use another JSON file to get the names of currencies instead of their currency codes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>main</code> should now ask the user which curreny code they would like to exchange their CAD into, and display the resulting amount converted to the target currency.
  <li><code>get_currency_name</code> will be a new function which takes in a string representing a currency code and will return the name of
  that currency. You will need a JSON file that stores the relationships between currency codes and names stored <a href="https://ualberta-cmput174.github.io/hosting-codealongs-on-github/module8/currency_symbols.json">here</a></li>
</ul>
