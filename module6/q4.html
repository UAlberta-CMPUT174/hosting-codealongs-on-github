<h1>Version 3</h1>

<p>In this final version of the game, we'll want to implement a way for the program to determine if the game should end. 
  The game has two possible end conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a space on the bard has been visited a MAX_VISITS times (for testing purposes, let's say the max is 3)</li>
  <li>all spaces on the board have been visited at least once</li>
</ul>

<p>Until the game ends, the program should keep updating and displaying the board, and prompting the user to roll the die.</p>

<p>We'll have a few final UDFs to define:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>is_game_over</code></li>
    <ul><li>This function checks to see if one of the two possible end game conditions are true. If one of them is true, then the game should end; otherwise, the game should continue on.</li></ul>
  <li><code>display_result</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This function displays a different message depending on how the game ended:</li>
    <li>"Congratulations, you won." is displayed if all squares on the board has been visited at least once</li>
    <li>"Unfortunately, you lost." is displayed if one of the squares on the board has been visited MAX_VISITS times</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
