<h1>Scenario:</h1>

<p>This problem will take us through building a game called Visit all Squares.</p>

<p>Visit all Squares is a roll and move board game. The board in this game is a sequence of squares 
  which are initialized with a value of 0. The number of squares in the board is entered by the player i.e. 
  the board can be as long as the player wants it to be. The number of sides of a die is also entered by the player. 
</p>

<p>At the start of the game, the game piece is not on the board. The player rolls a die and moves the 
  game piece onto the square of the board based on the value of the die. Each roll determines a new position for 
  the game piece relative to its old position. After each roll, the game displays the board showing the current position 
  of the game_piece and the number of times each square in the board has been visited. 
</p>

<p>In order to win the game, the player must move the game piece onto each square of the board at least once. 
  The board wraps around, so that the game piece always remains on the board. This allows the player to roll 
  the die and move the game piece on the board in a circular clockwise fashion. A player loses the game if the game piece 
  lands on the same square 3 times'.

<p>Now let's break this problem down into multiple versions. Each version after version 1 will contain 
  additional feature, building upon the previous version. 
  Implement and test each version thoroughly before moving onwards to the next version!
