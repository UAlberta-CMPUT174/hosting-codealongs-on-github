<h1>Version 2</h1>

<p>In this version, we want to add upon version 1 by allowing the board to update the number of times a 
  square has been visited, and display and update position the game piece on the board.</p>

<p>We'll need to add a new UDF for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>update_board</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This function will determine the new position of the game piece on the board by adding the roll to the previous position. It should also increment the number of times a game piece has visited each square on the board.</li>
    <li>Make sure to modify <code>display_board</code> so that it properly displays the game_piece on the board!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
