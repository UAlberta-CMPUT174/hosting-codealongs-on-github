<h1>Version 1</h1>
<p>In this version, we will be creating the base of the game. You'll want the game to be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create a game piece</li>
  <li>initialize the starting position of the game piece to NOT ON BOARD  </li>
  <li>prompt the user to enter the size of the board</li>
  <li>prompt the user to enter the number of sides of a die</li>
</ul>


<p>We'll also want to create some UDFs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>create_board</code></li>
  <ul><li>This function should take in the board_size as an argument, and create and initialize the board</li></ul>
  <li><code>display_board</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This function should display the initialized board. For example, if the board size is 5, a call to display_board should display:
      <pre>
      ===========
      |0|0|0|0|0|
      ===========</pre></li>
  </ul>
  <li><code>roll_die</code></li>
  <ul><li>This function should take in the number of sides as an argument and return the value of a roll. 
    The player should be prompted to press enter to roll, and the value of the roll should be randomly chosen.</li></ul>
    <li>And lastly, don't forget to include the <code>main</code> function!</li>
</ul>
