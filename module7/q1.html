<p>A little-known fact is that Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man have a son, Pac Boy. This is a game about him.</p>

<p>When the game starts, a 5x5 game board is displayed. Pac Boy, denoted by 👦, and occupies the top-left tile of the board. Three ghosts (👻) and five melons (🍉) are randomly placed in the other tiles. All other tiles are empty (🔹). </p>

<p>A player can move Pac Boy one tile at a time in one of 4 directions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> N for North</li>  
  <li>S for South</li>
  <li>E for East </li>
  <li>and W for West</li>
</ul>

<p>If the player enters any letter other than N or S or E or W, the message "Move invalid." is displayed and the 
  board remains unchanged. If the player enters a move that is a valid letter but requires Pac Boy to move to a location 
  that is out of the boundary of the board, the message "Move invalid." is displayed, and the board also remains unchanged in this case. </p>

<p>If a valid move is entered, Pac Boy will move to the new location. Each time Pac Boy moves to a new tile,
   the symbol (🔹 or 👻 or 🍉) in the new tile is replaced with the Pac Boy symbol (👦) and the last tile occupied 
   by Pac Boy is filled with 🔹. The updated board and the number of melons eaten by Pac Boy so far are also displayed.  
</p>

<p>The game ends if Pac Boy enters a tile occupied by a ghost or if he eats all of the melons. If Pac Boy eats all of the melons, 
  the message 'You Win!' is displayed, and the game ends. If Pac Boy enters the same tile as a ghost, 
  the message 'A Ghost Scared You!' is displayed. The game also ends if this condition is met.</p>
